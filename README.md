# SnakeGame
A SnakeGame project written in Python for the world-famous Nokia snake game!

The purpose of this project is to practice writing reusable and easy to maintain code.

The project was written using the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) library, and the goal is that after it is done
and working perfectly with PyGame I will add the ability to play it using the
[turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) library with as few as possible needed adjustments.

The end goal is that by a simple change of configuration the player will be able to using pygame or turtle.

## Support
