# SnakeGame
A SnakeGame project written in Python for the world famous snake game!

The purpose of this project is to practice writing reusable and easy to maintain code.

The project was written using the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) library, and the goal is that after it is done
and working perfectly with PyGame I will add the ability to play it using the [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) with as few as possible needed adjustments
